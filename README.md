# SOLID

## SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
The single responsibility principle is a computer programming principle that states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.

## OCP (Open Closed Principle)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
The principle of OCP suggests that software entities must be:
    * should be open for extension: this means, that module can be extended. When applications requirements change, we are able to expand the module.
In other words, we have the ability to extend classes, making them more functional. At the same time, the behavior of the old methods does not change, and class itself is not changing to.
    * closed for modification: after the expansion of the entity behavior, no changes should be made to the code that uses these entities.

## LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

## ISP (Interface segregation principle)

## DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)
